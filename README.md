A modern, responsive **data card** built with **Power BI DAX, HTML, and CSS** — inspired by clean glassmorphism and product cards.  
No JavaScript required — works inside any HTML Viewer or HTML Content visual in Power BI.

## 🗂️ What this is

This template helps you display:

✅ A beautiful **feature card** with:
- A gradient background (customisable colours for your brand)
- A title, tag, and clear description
- A call-to-action button
- A data-relevant image or icon (e.g. charts, products, people)

✅ 100% pure **DAX + HTML + CSS** — no external libraries.

✅ Hover effect to expand the image and slide in the content.

- You can connect dynamic text if needed.

### 2️⃣ HTML Content Visual
- Paste your measure into an **HTML Viewer** or **HTML Content** visual in Power BI.
- It renders the styled card exactly as you see in your browser.

### 3️⃣ Hover Effect
- Uses simple CSS transitions to animate the image and content.
